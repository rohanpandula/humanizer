# Humanizer

A portable agent skill that removes signs of AI-generated writing from text, making it sound more natural and human. It is plain Markdown, so it can run in any harness that supports skill-style instructions.

## About this fork

This is [Rohan Pandula's](https://github.com/rohanpandula) reader-first fork of [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer), originally created by Siqi Chen and distributed under the MIT License. It keeps the upstream 33-pattern catalog and adds an editing layer adapted from [Monzo's public writing principles](https://monzo.com/tone-of-voice):

- Lead with what changed, how it affects the reader, and what they need to do.
- Prefer plain, inclusive language without stripping out useful technical terms.
- Name responsibility in decisions, errors, and bad news.
- Apologize directly when the speaker caused a problem, then explain the remedy.
- Use concrete details instead of empty marketing language.
- Match warmth and humor to the context, with no jokes in sensitive messages.

The fork also tightens the preservation rules so rewrites do not invent facts, opinions, or personal anecdotes. Fork release 2.9.0 is based on upstream 2.8.2.

## Installation

### Skills CLI

Install with the cross-agent skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add rohanpandula/humanizer
```

Update an existing install:

```bash
npx skills update humanizer
```

To install into every supported agent harness:

```bash
npx skills add rohanpandula/humanizer --agent '*'
```

To target one configured harness, pass its agent name:

```bash
npx skills add rohanpandula/humanizer --agent <agent-name>
```

### Claude Code plugin

Claude Code users can also install Humanizer as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add rohanpandula/humanizer
/plugin install humanizer@humanizer
```

The skill is then invoked as `/humanizer:humanizer`.

### Manual

Any agent harness can use the skill directly because the runtime artifact is `SKILL.md`. Install it wherever your harness expects skill directories, or copy `SKILL.md` into an existing skill folder.

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohanpandula/humanizer.git /path/to/your/skills/humanizer
```

Or, if you already have this repo cloned:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/your/skills/humanizer
cp SKILL.md /path/to/your/skills/humanizer/
```

## Usage

Invoke the skill however your agent harness exposes installed skills. Common forms include a slash command or a direct request:

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

```
Please humanize this text: [your text]
```

### Voice Calibration

To match your personal writing style, provide a sample of your own writing:

```
/humanizer

Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching:
[paste 2-3 paragraphs of your own writing]

Now humanize this text:
[paste AI text to humanize]
```

The skill will analyze your sentence rhythm, word choices, and quirks, then apply them to the rewrite instead of producing generic "clean" output.

## Overview

Based on [Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) guide, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. This comprehensive guide comes from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text.

The skill also includes a final "obviously AI generated" audit pass and a second rewrite, to catch lingering AI-isms in the first draft. Its reader-first editing layer adapts ideas from [Monzo's Writing Principles](https://monzo.com/tone-of-voice) without copying Monzo's brand voice.

### Key Insight from Wikipedia

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."

## Reader-first editing principles

Humanizing prose is not only a matter of removing tells. The rewrite should also help its intended reader:

- Lead with the change, impact, action, or deadline before internal reasoning.
- Use ordinary, inclusive language while keeping technical terms that add precision.
- Name responsibility when it matters, especially for errors, decisions, and bad news.
- Apologize plainly when the speaker caused a problem, then explain the remedy.
- Prefer concrete details and precise verbs to empty marketing adjectives, and acknowledge genuine wins or frustrations without patronizing.
- Match personality to the stakes: no humor in sensitive messages, light warmth in operational copy, and restrained wit in expressive or marketing prose when the source voice supports it.

These principles do not authorize new facts, opinions, anecdotes, or jokes. The skill still preserves the source's meaning and voice.

## Full Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> I recently spent five unforgettable days in Lisbon, and let me tell you — this city completely stole my heart. From the moment I arrived, I knew I was somewhere truly special.
>
> Nestled along the banks of the Tagus River, Lisbon stands as a vibrant testament to Portugal's enduring spirit, where rich history and modern energy intertwine at every turn. Yes, the famous hills are challenging — my legs certainly felt it! — but every climb rewards you with breathtaking, panoramic views that make it all worthwhile.
>
> No trip would be complete without riding the iconic Tram 28, winding through the city's most historic neighborhoods. And the food? Simply divine. The original pastéis de nata at Pastéis de Belém are a beloved national treasure, and savoring one still warm was a moment I will never forget.
>
> But what truly makes Lisbon special isn't just the sights — it's the feeling. Wander a few steps off the main squares and you'll discover a quieter, more authentic side: sun-drenched alleys, charming tiled facades, and friendly locals going about their daily lives, inviting you to slow down and savor every moment.
>
> Of course, the must-see São Jorge Castle offers stunning views over the rooftops below. The queues can be long, but the experience is absolutely worth it for any history buff or curious traveler.
>
> Would I go back? Absolutely. Lisbon isn't just a place to visit — it's a place to fall in love with, again and again. If you're dreaming of your next getaway, this is one destination that promises memories to last a lifetime. ✨

**After (Humanized):**
> I spent five days in Lisbon and came home wanting to go back. The city won me over, sore legs and all.
>
> Lisbon sits along the Tagus, and its hills keep opening onto wide views of the water and rooftops. The climbs really are hard. That mix of old streets and busy city life makes the effort worth it.
>
> I rode Tram 28 through the historic neighborhoods, then ate a warm custard tart at Pastéis de Belém. The tram deserves its fame. The tart, even more.
>
> What I remember best is a few steps away from the main squares: sunlit alleys, tiled facades, and locals getting on with their day. The city feels quieter there without feeling empty.
>
> São Jorge Castle gives you another broad view over the rooftops. The queue was long, but I was still glad I went.
>
> I would return, hills and all. Next time I would spend less time ticking off the famous sights and more time wandering those side streets.
